Help on function irfft2 in numpy.fft:

numpy.fft.irfft2 = irfft2(a, s=None, axes=(-2, -1), norm=None)
    Computes the inverse of `rfft2`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape of the real output to the inverse FFT.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes over which to compute the inverse fft.
        Default is the last two axes.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
    
        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.
    
        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
    
            The "backward", "forward" values were added.
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The result of the inverse real 2-D FFT.
    
    See Also
    --------
    rfft2 : The forward two-dimensional FFT of real input,
            of which `irfft2` is the inverse.
    rfft : The one-dimensional FFT for real input.
    irfft : The inverse of the one-dimensional FFT of real input.
    irfftn : Compute the inverse of the N-dimensional FFT of real input.
    
    Notes
    -----
    This is really `irfftn` with different defaults.
    For more details see `irfftn`.
