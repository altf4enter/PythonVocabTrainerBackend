Help on function findall in re:

re.findall = findall(pattern, string, flags=0)
    Return a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string.
    
    If one or more capturing groups are present in the pattern, return
    a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern
    has more than one group.
    
    Empty matches are included in the result.
